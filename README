# VEGI (ˈve-jē') : Voice-Enhanced Gaming Interface

NPU - Intall env for ryzenai-transformers (need to add steps here later) and run setup.bat from RyzenAI

CPU - Should work after fufilling pip dependencies

GPU - Needs to add cuda support 


Two paths:

OCR - Grab games dialogue from input coordinates, need to calibrate it for pokemon for AMD Contest. 

Overwolf - Grab chat data from Overwolf API and writes to a files and vegi read from it. Need to streamline data transfer or package vegi with overwolf app. 


Run sample-app by following https://overwolf.github.io/start/basic-app/sample-app (only tested with League of Legends chat)
